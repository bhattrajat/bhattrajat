title: How to add skip to content link properly

Once I hosted my site, I was actively testing the accessibility of the site. I have used tools like [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/accessibility/) to check site's accessibility

To add some more checks I have decided to integrate [Axe core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) into Playwright test and I found that I was missing skip to content link which is a very important thing to improve the accessibility.

It is recommended to have **Skip to Content** link to be the first link in the DOM

So I have added the link as the first link in the header.

```html
<a
  className="absolute -top-full left-1/2 z-50 -translate-x-1/2 rounded px-4 py-2 transition-all focus:top-4"
  href="#main"
>
  Skip to content
</a>
```

While adding the **Skip to content** We need to make sure few points

- It is not required to have the link visible until we press tab keyword
- To make the link not visible we can't use `display:hidden` property since it will not focus the link if we press tab
- So to add the link we can use CSS absolute & transform property to move the link in the area where it won't be visible.
- Also we need to make sure we have main as id in the content area.

```html
<header>...</header>
<main role="main" id="main" className="p-4 md:p-8"></main>
```

So when the user will press the tab key we can use `:focus` pseudo class to make it visible again by resetting the transform. We can also use CSS transition to animate it to add extra attention.

I hope this explanation was helpful to understand adding skip link to improve accessibility in your projects. Please let me know if you have any suggestions/improvements for this article.
